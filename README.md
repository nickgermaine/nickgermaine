### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Canadian software developer, and CTO.

I love clean designs, efficient code, and long walks on the beach.  I'm also a huge fan of material design because it does most of those things.  Also kind of a fan of Fluent design, ngl.  

I try to build the apps that I would want to use.  Currently working on Liri Music, with plans for a gtk based email client when Liri Music (finally) reaches a 1.0 release.

Aside from open source (free time) development, I'm currently working as lead developer for a company, and am an owner and CTO of another company.

I also make music sometimes.

## Projects

### Liri Music
https://github.com/lirios/music

Tech stack: C++, Qt5, QML, Taglib



Liri Music (a material design inspired music player) was started on Dec 9, 2015, named Vinyl Music; because Vinyl is a type of material, and it's also related to music.  The original Liri Project devs invited me into the Liri Project, and the rest, as they say, is history.  Kind of literally, here, because it's been 7 years and Liri Music is probably only about 50% complete.

I've had an on and off relationship with the app, but I'm pushing forward to see it to it's first official release in the near future.  The app will include albums, songs, playlists, and the ability to modify the meta tags of all of those object types.

### Eden Browser
https://github.com/nickgermaine/Eden-Browser

Tech stack: C++, Qt5

Eden browser was a project I started on Jan 20, 2017.  It, too, has suffered the same fate as Liri Music.  The dark fate of an incomplete app, in an on and off relationship with it's developer.  The app is build entirely inside C++, using C++ representations of QT objects.  It features a custom window frame, normal and private windows, and a fully functional devtools component.

I had also planned to add support for chrome extensions, and, you know, to eventually release it.  Maybe a release is in Edens future.
